## CSS Transforms

#### Transforms
The transform property comes in two different settings:
- two-dimensional  
- three-dimensional  
Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.  

#### Transitions & Animations  
Transitions:
- potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted,  
- allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes,  
- provides a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes,  
Animations:
- new CSS property that allows for animation of most HTML elements,  
- At the moment, it’s supported in Webkit browsers, including Safari 4+, Safari for iOS (iOS 2+), Chrome 1+ and, more recently, Firefox   
> Unsupported browsers will simply ignore your animation code, so ensure that your page doesn’t rely on it!  
- prefixes for the browser vendors are required  
- the syntax is exactly the same for each browser

### Question and Answers  
1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?
**CSS transform:**
- powerful set of tools to modify appearance and position of an element on a web page,
- allows developers to apply various visual transformations to an element, such as:
    - scaling,  
    - rotation,  
    - skewing,  
    - translation,  
- provides options to apply trandformation in 2D/3D space
2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website. 
> **Example:** `scale`  
- it allows to scale an element, making it larger/smaller
**Purpose**   
- zooming images
- hoover efects
- responsivnes of the design
**Other Examples**
 - rotation - `rotation`,  
 - skew - `skewX`,  
 - translation - `translateX`,
 - 3D transformation,  
 - scaling and transition,
 3. What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?
It allows developer to smoothly animate specific CSS properties of an element over a defined duration.
**Advantages:**
- User Experience improvement,  
- Possibility to create engaging effects (fading, sliding, scaling),  
- Timing and easing control, 
- support responsive design,  
4. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?
- CSS animations allow for more complex and continuous animations with precise control over intermediate states and timing using keyframes.   
- CSS transitions are simpler and typically used for transitions between two states of an element, such as hover effects, with a defined duration and timing function.  
5. What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?
**Benefits:**
- User Experience improvement,  
- Possibility to create engaging effects (fading, sliding, scaling),  
- Timing and easing control, 
- support responsive design,  
- performace optimization,  
- animation process is simplified 
6. How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?
I think that it will be very useful for my final project or/and my future projects which will be focused on Photography/Art portfolios. I can imagine that thanks to transforms and trasintions I can enhance the visual and UX of portfolio websites I create. Properties I could use to enhance the style:
- Image Scaling and Cropping,  
- Image Sliders and Carousels,  
- Image Zoom and Hover Effects,  
- 3D Transformations and Galleries,  
- Artistic Transitions and Animations,  
- Custom Layouts and Compositions
