### Morning session
**constructor function**  
- allows us to create object with less code.
- is written in almost same way as normal function, except that we Must capitalize first letter:  
function Kitten()
this.name = "bob";
this.age = 0;
this.interests = ["cuddling", "chasing string", "catnip"];
isGoodWithKids = true;
isGoodWithDogs = false;
isGoodWithCats = true;


// const eric = new Kitten();
// const bob = new Kitten();
// console.log(eric);
// console.log(bob);

- every object has prototype object
    - allows us to create a method outside of constructor function
- Prototype method:
     - start declaring constructor function
- Prototypw inheritance
### Questions and Asnwers:  

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?  

2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.  

3. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?  

4. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?  

5. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
