## Read: 01 - Learning Markdown
### 1. What is Markdown?
- lightweight markup language <br>
- can be used to add formatting elements to plain text documents
- has been created by John Gruber in 2004
- one of the world's most popular markup languages
- it is different editor than **WYSIWYG (described below)**:
  + as example it can be Microsoft Word and its predecessors
  + it contains buttons that helps to format text by clicking
  + changes in __WYSIWYG__ are visible immediately
- markdown requires syntax added to the text when we want to indicate which word and phrases should look different
- example of different *syntax*:
  + **#** - we use it if we want to denote a heading
  + ** -  to emphasise text as bold
- can be added to plain text as well as via Markdown apps for most of the operational systems 
- there are several web-based apps designed specifically for writing in Markdown 
- (some applications don't support preview of formatted documents)
- Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and unobtrusive, so the text in Markdown file can be read even if it is not rendered
### 2. Why do we use Markdown?
- can be used for everything (websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages and tech documentation)
- is portable - can be opened in any virtual application that supports Markdown (can be used between different Markdown apps)
- it is platform independent - Markdown formatted text can be created on any device running any operating system
- is future proof and in some way timeless, when other apps are outdated or aged Markdown will still allow reading Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. That's important consideration for books, thesis and other milestone/important documents that must be preserved
- it is everywhere, e.g. Reddit, Github
### 3. What symbol will create a heading Markdown?
**hashtag - #**  
  a) How many do we need to create the largest heading?  
1 - #  
  b) How many do we need to create the smallest heading?  
6 - ######  
### 4. When making text **bold** or *italicized* for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?
- '* word */_ word _' - emphasis text and render it as italic  
- '** word **/__ word __' - renders text as bold emphasis  
underscores shouldn't be used in the middle of the word, if we need to highlight letters in the middle of the world , we should use asterix.
### 5. How do you create a link with a Markdown?
- enclose the link in text brackets (e.g., [A Film Photographer]) and then follow immediately with the URL in parentheses (www.afilmphotographer.com). 
> Example:
> - [A Film Photographer](www.afilmphotographer.com)
> - <www.afilmphotographer.com>  
### 6. What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?
- symbols should be followed by space  
'-'  
'*'  
'+'
