1. What is a wireframe?
- Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product
- When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code
- A commonly-used argument for wireframing is that if a user doesn’t know where to go on a plain hand-drawn diagram of your site page, then it is irrelevant what colors or fancy text eventually get used
2. Wireframe examples
- can be done in app like figma, Invision or Balsamiq

- can be done by hand on paper - Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change
