### Wireframe and Design
[My Figma Project](https://www.figma.com/file/sScz1kH8vxtNCzLv9uhmvH/Yaga-on-Film-Project?type=design&node-id=0-1&t=O03zntYyVHIbcEcE-0)
1. What is a wireframe?
- a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product
- When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code
- A commonly-used argument for wireframing is that if a user doesn’t know where to go on a plain hand-drawn diagram of your site page, then it is irrelevant what colors or fancy text eventually get used
2. Wireframe examples:
- can be done in app like figma, Invision or Balsamiq  
- can be done by hand on paper - Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change  
3. Things to consider before you start wireframing:
- number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:
    - Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
    - Sketch > Code
    - Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
    - Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code
4. The best tools for wireframing:
- **UXPin**: UXPin has a wide range of functionalities, but one of the best ones is how it facilitates building responsive, clickable prototypes directly in your browser.
- **InVision**: InVision allows you to get feedback straight from your team and users through clickable mock-ups of your site design. It’s completely free too!
- **Wireframe.cc**: Wireframe.cc provides you with the technology to create wireframes really quickly within your browser, the online version of pen and paper.
5. 6 Steps to make a wireframe
- Do your research
- Prepare your research for quick reference
- Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
- Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
- Start turning your wireframes into prototypes
- Add some detail and get testing
6. How to make your wireframe good: Three key principles
- Clarity
- Confidence
- Simplicity is key

### Mozilla HTML Basics
1. What is HTML:
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- code that is used to structure a web page and its content
- a markup language that defines the structure of your content
- consists of a series of *elements*:
    - part of a webpage
    - may contain a data item or a chunk of text or an image, or perhaps nothing
    - A typical element includes an opening tag with some attributes, enclosed text content, and a closing tag
- enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, etc.
