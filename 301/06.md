What Are the Various Types of HTTP Request Methods discussed on the morning class:
- GET -  is used to retrieve and request data from a specified resource in a server. GET is one of the most popular HTTP request techniques. In simple words, the GET method is used to retrieve whatever information is identified by the Request-URL.  
- PUT - PUT is similar to POST as it is used to send data to the server to create or update a resource. The difference between the two is that PUT requests are idempotent. This means that if you call the same PUT requests multiple times, the results will always be the same.  
- DELETE - Just as it sounds, the DELETE request method is used to delete resources indicated by a specific URL. Making a DELETE request will remove the targeted resource.  

**API** - application programing interface; a set of functions and procedures allowing the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service.

**.env** (Environment variables)  
- used to store sensitive data such as passwords, API credentials, and other information that should not be written directly in code   
- is a shell command for Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is used to either print a list of environment variables or run another utility in an altered environment without having to modify the currently existing environment

**Axios** - is a library that serves to create HTTP requests that are present externally. It is evident from the fact that we may sometimes in React applications need to get data from the external source. It is quite difficult to fetch such data so that they can be normally shown on the website.  

**try catch** - error handler

**locationIQ** - watch the demo on the webesite [LocationIQ](https://my.locationiq.com/dashboard/?firstLogin=1)  
LocationIQ provides flexible enterprise-grade location based solutions. We work with developers, startups and enterprises worldwide serving billions of requests everyday. This page provides an overview of the technical aspects of our API and will help you get started.  

**404 error code** - means that a server could not find a client-requested webpage
