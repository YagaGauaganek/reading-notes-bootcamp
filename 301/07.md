## Mono repo
### Create a mono repo

1. in the terminal:
- mkdir wild-west
- cd wild-west
- mkdir server
- cd .. this will take you back to wild-west directory
- code . this will open the wild-west directory in VSCode

2. In the terminal in VScode
- cd server
- touch server.js
- npm init -y
- npm i express dotenv cors nodemon
- change package.json start script to nodemon

3. Inside server.js
- const express = require("express")
- const cors = require("cors")
- require("dotenv").config()
- const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080
- const app - express()
- app.use(cors())
- app.listen(PORT, ()=>console.log(app is listening on port ${PORT}))
- create a test route 
    - app.get("/", (request, response)=>{
    response.status(200).json("you are looking at my root route. How roude.")
    })
- In the terminal enter npm start
    - the teminal should log the console.log from app.listen()
- In your browser go to localhost:8090 you should see the response:
    - you are looking at my root route. How roude.

4. Create a new endpoint
    - app.get("/survive", (request, response)=>{
    const scenarios = ["You made it to the saloon congrats","You died of dsyentery""A snake gotcha","Your horse made it... you did not","You found gold","You found oil","You didn't even attempt to cross the Oregon trail."]
    const randonNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * scenarios.length)
    const outcome = scenarios[randomNum]

    response.json(outcome)
    })
