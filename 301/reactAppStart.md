## Notes on starting a React Application
### Step 1
Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store your React project.

#### Run the following command

npx create-react-app nameOfProject
Once the code has finished it will say "happy hacking"

cd nameOfProject
code .
### Step 2
There is alot created within the project when using create-react-app and we don't need all of it. Delete the following:

app.test.js
index.css
logo.svg
reportwebvitals.js
setUpTests.js
Follow these instructions in the remiaining files.:

app.css
delete everything
app.js
Delete import logo from "./logo.svg"
Delete everything between the header element including the header element itself.
index.js
Delete import "./index.css"
Delete import reportWebVitals from "./reportWebVitals"
Delete all the green code at the bottom of the component.
We now have the basis of our react project.

### Step 3
Create a Reset.css file if you want one.
Add this to your App.js on the line before your App.css in the App.js file.
Set up your components folder
Start to build out your code
Functional component
Shortcut for starter code rfc tab
First way to write the functional component, export the component, import the component.

function Grid() {
  return (
    <div className="grid">
      <p>This is the Grid</p>
    </div>
  );
}
export default Grid;
Second way to write the functional component and export the component.

export default function Grid() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>This is the Grid</p>
    </div>
  );
}
import the component into the component you want to use it.

import "./App.css";

import Grid from "./components/grid/Grid";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Grid />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
Open the react project in the browser
We no longer use go live.

We now need to open a terminal and run the command npm start

Link Local repo to GitHub
Go to github and click to create a new repository.
Name the repo the same as the react project you created.
Do not add a readme.md or a gitignore as these are created by create-react-app
click create repository
Scroll to where it says or push an existing repository from the command line
copy the first line from the instructions
paste this into the terminal on the main branch
copy the third line (miss out the second line)
paste this into the terminal on the main branch
then run the following ACP commands as usual
git add .
git commit -m "update"
git push
